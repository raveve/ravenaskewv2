Updated one page resume site utilizing Bootstrap CSS and their JS accordion

<p>Updated my first <a href="https://github.com/raveve/ravenaskew">website</a>.</p>

<p>Used Bootstrap's grid system as well as their JS accordion.</p>

<p>Customized the accordion to match the website style as well as overrode a lot of Boostrap's specific styles so the elements matched the overall style and theme.</p>

<p>Should be fully responsive although not perfect.</p>

<p>Any and all suggestions and ideas welcome! Code reviews welcome!</p>

<p>I will continue to update the site over time to incorporate new skills I learn and make the site better.</p>
